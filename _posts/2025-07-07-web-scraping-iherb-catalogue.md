# Working in progress - Web Scraping to Create a Catalogue of iHerb Nutrition Supplements

#### Category: Python

---

I had a business idea to sell iHerb products to customers in South Korea.

As part of brainstorming the business process, I wanted to obtain a list of nutritional supplements sold on iHerb, along with some sales-related information about them.

Next, I planned to check whether other vendors are currently selling these products on a specific online marketplace platform, and if so, gather the relevant sales information.
